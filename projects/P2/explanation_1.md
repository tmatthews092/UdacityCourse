I chose the Newton-Raphson square method to find the square root of a number since this was the simplest to execute given the adaption from wikipedia.

The space complexity is O(1) since we are only using variable assignment without lists.
The time complexity is O(F(n)logn) where F(n) cost of determining the closeness to the real square root.
