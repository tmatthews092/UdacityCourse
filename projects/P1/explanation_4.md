There we're any data structures that I used in this example, however, I decided to use recursion since this was very similar to the file extension problem. Its a array within an array, and to identify those nested elements we can easily use recursion to solve the problem.

Time Complexity is O(n) since we need to iterate over every element in the worst case scenario

Space Complexity is O(1) since we're not storing anything and return a bool vaue
